    # Automatically retry the job on failure.
    #
    # The following retry algorithm is used to automatically retry a job when it fails:
    # Failed jobs are aborted so that they cannot be restarted since a new instance has there are workers
    # available to run. For example if workers are busy working on higher priority jobs, then the job
    # will only run once those jobs have completed, or their priority lowered. Additionally, while the
    # job is queued no additional instances will be enqueued, even if the next cron interval has been reached.
    #
    # Note:
    # - After failure the job is scheduled to run again in the future.
    # - The job will not be retried if:
    #   - The job has expired.
    #   - The job fails validations.
    #   - The number of retry counts has been exceeded.
    # - To see the number of times a job has failed so far:
    #     job.failure_count
    #
    # Example:
    #
    # class MyJob < RocketJob::Job
    #   include RocketJob::Plugins::Retry
    #
    #   # Set the default retry_count
    #   self.max_retries = 3
    #
    #   def perform
    #     puts "DONE"
    #   end
    # end
    #
    # # Queue the job for processing using the default cron_schedule specified above
    # MyJob.create!
    #
    # # Replace the default retry_count
    # MyCronJob.create!(max_retries: 10)
    #
    # # Disable retries for this job instance
    # MyCronJob.create!(max_retries: 0)
